    <p>Hi @Model.Recepient.Firstname 👋<p>
        <br />
    <p>Welcome and thanks for joining Talk2Me! We hope you will enjoy practicing language with us. Here are 4 steps to help start your journey:<p>
    <p>
        <div>1️⃣ Go to <a href="https://t2m.app/rooms/find">Find a Room page</a> and enter any room which works for you.</div>
        <div>2️⃣ If you didn’t find the appropriate room, create your own room and wait until someone enters your room or invite you friends to practice together.</div>
        <div>3️⃣ Wait until the time comes and join the call.</div>
        <div>4️⃣ Practice language. Ask questions. Use new words. And have fun!</div>
    </p>
